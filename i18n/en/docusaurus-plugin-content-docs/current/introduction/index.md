For individuals managing personal projects or those responsible for IT operations in small businesses who need to manage multiple domain names, applying for certificates manually comes with several drawbacks:

- üò± Troublesome: Applying for and deploying certificates isn‚Äôt difficult, but it can be quite a hassle, especially when managing multiple domains.
- üò≠ Easily forgotten: The current free certificate has a validity period of only 90 days, requiring regular renewal operations. This increases the workload and makes it easy to forget, which can result in the website becoming inaccessible.

Certimate was created to solve the above-mentioned issues and has the following advantages:

- **Local Deployment**: Simply to install, download the binary and run it directly. Supports Docker deployment and source code deployment for added flexibility.
- **Data Security**‚Äã: With private deployment, all data is stored on your own servers, ensuring it never resides on third-party systems and maintaining full control over your data.
- **Easy Operation**: Effortlessly apply and deploy SSL certificates with minimal configuration. The system automatically renews certificates before expiration, providing a fully automated workflow, no manual intervention required.

Certimate aims to provide users with a secure and user-friendly SSL certificate management solution.
