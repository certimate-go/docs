# FAQ

## Basic usage {#basic-usage}

### Do you provide SaaS services?

> No, we do not provide that. Currently, we only support self-hosted.

### Is data security really?

> Since only self-hosted is supported, all data is stored on the user’s server. Additionally, the source code of Certimate is open-source, and the packaging process for binary files and Docker images is entirely done using GitHub Actions. This process is transparent and visible, allowing for independent auditing.

### How long is the validity period of the certificates?

> It depends on the certificate authorities, as the current mainstream ACME CA issued free certificates have a validity period of only 90 days. Certimate can re-apply certificates and deploy them before expiration by automated workflows.

### Forget password?

> Please refer to _[Getting Started / Configuration / Reset Password](/docs/getting-started/configuration#reset-password)_ section.

### Why only 127.0.0.1:8090 can be accessed?

> Please refer to _[Getting Started / Configuration / Set the Listening URL](/docs/getting-started/configuration#set-listening-url)_ section.

### Why the actual execution time of the workflow is different from the set time?

> Perhaps because you are running Certimate in Docker, and the images we provide default to UTC time (as we cannot assume the user's time zone). You can binding mount `/etc/localtime` and `/etc/timezone` to the container.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### Unable to run Certimate?

> If you run Certimate in a binary deployment, please check whether the command-line argument `serve` is missing.
>
> If you run Certimate in other deployment methods, please refer to the error logs for troubleshooting.

### Unable to apply certificates?

#### The error logs contain "could not find zone _xxx_", "zone _xxx_ not found":

> Perhaps because your domain name resolution includes CNAME wildcard resolution. According to the specification, CNAME has the highest priority, so the TXT resolution record cannot be queried during the DNS-01 challenge process.
>
> You can try turning on the "Disable CNAME following" switch in the application node configuration.

#### The error logs contain "authoritative nameservers: _xxx_ returned SERVFAIL for \_acme-challenge._xxx_.":

> Perhaps because your domain name resolution records did not take effect in the authoritative nameservers.
>
> You can try setting the "DNS recursive nameservers" to a public DNS (such as `8.8.8.8` or `1.1.1.1`), and setting a larger "DNS propagation checks timeout" value (such as 600s) in the application node configuration. You can also try setting the "DNS propagation waiting time" value (such as 30s) to skip local checks.

#### The error logs contain "NXDOMAIN looking up TXT for \_acme-challenge._xxx_ - check that a DNS record exists for this domain":

> Same as above.

#### The error logs contain "propagation: time limit exceeded":

> Same as above.

#### The error logs contain "NS _xxx_ did not return the expected TXT record \[fqdn: \_acme-challenge._xxx_\]":

> Perhaps because you have previously used other SSL certificate tools, there are legacy TXT parsing records that have not been deleted.
>
> You can try cleaning up the useless `_acme-challenge.` and `_dnsauth.` TXT records.
>
> If you have recently changed the domain name registrar or modified the NS server, it may also be due to cached resolution records, and you need to wait 48-72 hours before trying again.

#### The error logs contain "acme:error:rateLimited":

> You've hit a rate limit of Let's Encrypt.

#### The error logs contain "dial tcp: lookup acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org on 127.0.0.11:53: i/o timeout"

> Unable to connect to Let's Encrypt server. Please check your network connection status.

### Unable to deploy certificates?

#### Can't find certificate files after deploying to local?

> Perhaps because you are running Certimate in Docker, 'local' refers to the container rather than the host.
>
> You can:
>
> - Binding mount of the saving path to the host;
> - Alternatively, choose to deploy to the host using SSH.

#### Error on deploying to SSH: "failed to open remote file: sftp: "Failure"(SSH FX FAILURE)":

> Perhaps due to insufficient permissions or insufficient disk space.
>
> It may also be because you entered an invalid file saving path in the deployment node configuration.

### Certificate error in browser?

#### Using a wildcard domain certificate, but browser prompts "SSL host name does not match certificate":

> The wildcard domain name `*.example.com` can only match the second level domain name, such as `www.example.com`, `static.example.com`，but not match `example.com`.
>
> You need to apply for `*.example.com; example.com` both in one certificate at the same time.

#### The operating system is too old, but browser prompts "This CA root certificate is not trusted":

> Please refer to Let's Encrypt's instructions about certificate compatibility:
> https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificate-compatibility/
