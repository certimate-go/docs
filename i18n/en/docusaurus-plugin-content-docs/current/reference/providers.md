# Providers

Provider refers to a third party that provides specific services.

There are several kinds of providers:

- `DNS provider`: The provider that hosts your domain names and manages your DNS records.
- `Hosting provider`: The provider that hosts your servers or cloud services for deploying certificates.
- `CA provider`: The provider which is certificate authority. Only CAs that use the ACME protocol are supported currently.
- `Notification provider`: The provider used for pushing notifications.

### My domain registrar is not on the list? {#unlisted-domain-registrars}

Since automation of issuance and renewals is really important, it only makes sense to use DNS-01 challenges if your DNS provider has an API you can use to automate updates.

Before we provide a support for this, you can continue to use Certimate in any of the following ways.

1. Set your domain's NS server to the supported providers mentioned above (note that this is only a modification of NS, not a transfer of your domain registrar!);
2. Using CNAME records to the supported providers mentioned above;
3. Use [ACME DNS](https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns).

In future versions, we may add a feature that allows users to manually satisfying DNS-01 challenges.
